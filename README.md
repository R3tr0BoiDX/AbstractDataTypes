# AbstractDataTypes
Basic abstract data types implemented in C++

## Graphs
Implementation of a adjacency matrix and adjacency list graph
Both capable of:
* check if empty
* adding edges weighted and directed
* printing them
* doing a depth first search (DFS) for a given start vertex
* doing a breadth first search (BFS) for a given start vertex
* check if there are cirlces
* calculate the shortes path with Dijkstra's algorithmus for given vertex
* doing a topological sort (almost, matrix has it's problems there)

## BinarySearchTree
Implementation of a binary search tree
Capable of:
* check if emty
* get root
* get current node
* get size
* insert data
* print in pre, in and post order
* get layers
* search for node
* delete a node (0, 1 or 2 children)
* rotate left and right
* balance
* set data of node
* clear tree
* print as data structure

## Stack, queue and linked lists
Implementation of a
* Stack
* Queue
* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List

### Stack
Capable of:
* check if emptx
* check if full
* push element
* pop element
* get element
* get maximum capacity 
* get current size

### Queue
Capable of:
* check if emptx
* check if full
* enqueue element
* dequeue element
* get element
* get maximum capacity 
* get current size

### Singly Linked List 
Capable of:
* check if empty
* check if pointing at start
* check if pointing at end
* advance the position pointer
* reset the position pointer to start
* insert new node at current position
* get data from current node
* destroy current node with data
* get size of list
* print as data structure

### Doubly Linked List 
Capable of:
* check if empty
* check if pointing at start
* check if pointing at end
* advance the position pointer
* reset the position pointer to start
* insert new node before current position
* insert new node after current position
* get data from current node
* destroy current node with data
* get size of list
* print as data structure
